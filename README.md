# Purpose
The purpose of the new analysis is to summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by PyBer.
# Results
It comes as no surprise there is a great deal more business for ride sharing in the urban vs rural environment.  Suburban areas are a definite middle ground.  Let's look at the [numbers](https://github.com/AraKippa/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/driverfare.PNG). There are 10 times more rides in urban vs rural settings.  It should be noted, however the cost per ride, and the amount per driver, is significantly less in urban vs rural areas. For the visual learners among us, this chart shows a similar story broken downn over a four month [span](https://github.com/AraKippa/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/farechart.PNG). This is likely due to distance driven, as most things in the city are fairly close by. People might only need ride sharing if transporting heavy items or using them as designated driver services.
# Summary
Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:
 - One.  Focus on small, fuel efficient cars for your urban ride share.  With the distances driven and stop and go traffic, it would pay to economize there.
 - Two.  Rural areas are spending more and if you could offer trucks as part of the service, it would not doubt drive ride sharing.
 - Three Always check out over saturation in the market.  We want to go where it's not too crouded already and; I think if you focus on service, both for the ride sharers and the drivers, it could set you apart.
